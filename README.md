# Pizza With Strangers

Pizza allows people to feel more comfortable, relaxed and in a mood to make some new friends.

Pizza With Strangers is a web application to host and attend pizza parties with strangers in select cities around the globe. The site uses Rails backend, PostgreSQL database and React.js with a Redux architectural framework frontend.

## Future Plans

I plan to continue working on Pizza With Strangers to add extra features and functionality.

### User Dashboard

The dashboard will be a space where users can see all the events that they are attending. Hosts will also be able to view, edit and delete events they are hosting.

### User Profile

Users will be able to see other user's profile. Users will also be able to see who is attending events that they are attending.
